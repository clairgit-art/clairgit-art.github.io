<h1>MY HUMBLE BEGINNING</h1>
<p>My <b>journey</b> into web development began with a spark of curiosity. 
    I was fascinated by how websites seamlessly blended text, images,
    and interactive elements to create engaging experiences.
    This curiosity led me to explore online resources,starting with basic HTML and CSS tutorials.
    I devoured online courses, experimenting with code snippets and building simple 
    websites like personal portfolios and landing pages.
    The thrill of seeing my code transform into a visual reality fueled my passion, and I gradually delved deeper into JavaScript, learning about its dynamic capabilities. 
    This initial exploration ignited a lifelong passion for web development</p>

    <p>In summary, this is just a break down of my work below</p>
